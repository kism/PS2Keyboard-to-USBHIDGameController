#PS2Keyboard-to-USBHIDGameController

Using the Teensy Microcontroller.

Why did I choose such a long repo name?

Why did I choose such a bad repo name?

## Requirements
1. Teensy, I used the Teensy-LC but im assuming that all the current ones will work.
2. Some way of connecting a PS/2 Keyboard to the Teensy, I used the MiniDIN-6 mounted socket avalible on Adafruit
3. My very slightly (like literally three lines of code total) modified Arduino PS/2 Keyboard library avalible at https://github.com/kism/PS2Keyboard
4. The Teensyduino add-on for the official Arduino IDE (Make sure the USB type is set to one of the Joystick options)
